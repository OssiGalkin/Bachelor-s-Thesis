## Abstract

Structure of complex system is a result of its parts interaction. Therefore, examination of separate elements is not sufficient to describe the behavior of the whole system. However, complex systems can be modelled as networks. This approach allows to concentrate on interaction and activity between the elements. This bachelor's thesis goes through how social systems and their interactions can be described as a small-world networks.

This work is a review of the literature of small-world networks, their mathematical basis and their role in describing social interaction. Specifically, I have investigated how the small-world networks properties can be used in the design structure of the company, how the resilience of networks can be improved, how this can be utilized in the fight against HIV, as well as to the how and why of human social environment can be mapped social media.
